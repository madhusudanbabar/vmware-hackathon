Hello Good AFternoon everybody
	We are from AISSMS IOIT Pune and we are presenting the best system for the sustainable college labs  where the power and money can be saved and it's sustainable system. In this model we have studied about the date-time of usage of computer, type/model of computer, CPU/memory/network utilization, disk I/O, shutdown, power ON/idle, sleep/log off/hibernate mode of that computer machine. The  data usage of any software at any time  can be represented by graphical representation which is the part of data visualization. According to the power consumption by each computer per day the machine having lowest power consumption for maximum time can be considered as idle computer machine. We have given a history of data and realtime data also we have given a summary of total power saving and annual cost reduction. The lab assistance have the authority to ON and OFF the machine.
